# üêß Interactive Linux User & Group Management Tool (Bash Script)

## ‚ú® Project Overview

This project is an advanced **Bash shell script** designed to simplify common system administration tasks related to user and group management on Linux systems. It features a fully interactive, menu-driven interface built using the **`whiptail`** utility, making complex `useradd`, `usermod`, `groupadd`, and `groupdel` commands accessible via user-friendly dialog boxes.

The tool ensures all required and optional parameters (like Home Directory, UID, Comment, and Group) are collected robustly before execution.

### User Management

* **Modify User**: Allows modification of user properties (Comment, Primary Group, Home Directory, UID).
* **Delete User**: Permanently removes a user and their home directory after confirmation.
* **Disable/Enable User**: Locks (`usermod -L`) or unlocks (`usermod -U`) user accounts.
* **Change Password**: Prompts for a new password using the secure console `passwd` command.
* **List Users**: Displays current users along with their Primary Group IDs.
